<pre>Note: much of the description below is compiled from the following sources:

    <i>Programming Expert Systems in OPS5</i>, by Lee Brownston, et al., Addison-Wesley, 1985.
    <i>VAX OPS5 Reference Manual</i>, Digital Equipment Corp., 1985.
    
An OPS5 program consists of a declaration section where basic data constructs
are defined followed by a production section where rules for manipulation of
the data.  OPS5 data elements reside in a global database referred to as
working memory; rules are stored in production memory. 

OPS5 programs execute by matching working memory elements with rules in
production memory and firing (executing) the most dominant rule which is
matched.  The Match-Select-Execute cycle continues until the program halts 
explicitly or until no rules can be matched to the working memory.

This cycle will be explained in greater detail as we flesh out the details of
both working memory elements and productions.

Below are several sample OPS5 programs:

<b>DATA TYPES</b>
  
Atoms

    Numeric

        <i>Integers</i>
        
            EBNF:  
        
                <i>decimalDigit</i> ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
                <i>integer</i>      ::= [+|-] <i>decimalDigit</i> {<i>decimalDigit</i>} [.]
            
            For example,
            
                +42
                12
                6. 
                -56.

        <i>Floating-point</i>
        
            EBNF:
            
                <i>exp</i>   ::= e <i>integer</i>
                <i>float</i> ::= [+|-] {<i>decimalDigit</i>} [.] <i>decimalDigit</i> {<i>decimalDigit</i>} [<i>exp</i>]                          
                
            For example,
                
                0.0
                2.717
                -.3e+22
                42e+2
          
    Symbolic
    
        Any atom (sequence of characters) which has no numeric meaning is a
        symbolic atom.
        
        Predefined
          
            NIL    
          
        User-defined, for example,
          
            LEE
            Lee
            grant
            927-2300
            255 Grapevine Road
            South_Boston
            South Boston
            (apple)
            (apple {orange) kumquat)
            a^;(
            ?-c
     
    Note: To include spacing, parentheses, braces, circumflex or semicolons the
    atoms must be delimited by vertical bars, that is,
     
            |255 Grapevine Road|
            |South Boston|
            |(apple)|
            |(apple {orange) kumquat)|
            |a^;(|
              
    Atoms delimited by vertical bars are called "quoted atoms." The VAX OPS5 runtime 
    system does not distinguish between case in characters used in atoms, unless they 
    are quoted.  Thus,  Lee and LEE are synonyms, but |Lee| and |LEE| are unique.

<b>WORKING MEMORY</b>

Working memory elements are declared in the first section of an OPS5 program.
An element class is decalred with the <code>literalize</code> command, whose EBNF is,

    (literalize className {attributeName})

For example, we might declare a class called student as follows,

    (literalize Student
        id
        gpa
        current-class
        major
        major-2
        major-3
        minor-1
        minor-2
    )

which indicates that the production system will contain data about Student
entities, for whom seven different attributes have been declared.  Note that
Student is the className, and gpa through minor-2 are attributes of the class. 
Note, also, that the language does not require (or allow) us to declare the types of
the attributes, only their names.  Thus, gpa could contain the values 3, 2.45, pi
or even Howdy-Doody.

As indicated in the EBNF, a class need not have attributes, for example, it is
common to define context classes such as,

    (literalize Print-Results)
    
to control flow of the OPS5 program, as described later.  It is important to
distinguish the difference between the declaration of an element class from the
actual instantiation of working memory elements (WMEs).  Declaring a class does
not reserve memory locations.  In order to actually create a WME, one uses the
make command, for example,

    (make Student ^id 99666666 ^gpa 2.10 ^major CS ^minor MA ^minor-2 CH)
    (make Student ^id 99777777 ^gpa 3.0 ^major CS ^minor BI ^minor-2 YM)
    (make Student ^id 99888888)
    (make Student ^major-2 EN)
    (make Student)

instantiates five WMEs with the attribute values inidicated.  Any attribute
that is not explicitly instantiated with a value will be initialized with the value 
NIL.

Working memory elements have two additional fields associated with them.  To
examine working memory, the OPS5 command wm is used,

    OPS&gt;wm
    
    1 [NIL] (STUDENT ^ID 99666666 ^GPA 2.10 ^MAJOR CS ^MINOR MA ^MINOR-2 CH)
    2 [NIL] (STUDENT ^ID 99777777 ^GPA 3.0 ^MAJOR CS ^MINOR BI ^MINOR-2 YM)
    3 [NIL] (STUDENT ^ID 99888888)
    4 [NIL] (STUDENT ^MAJOR-2 EN)
    5 [NIL] (STUDENT)
    
In this view of the working memory, the first number is referred to as the time
tag for the memory element.  The larger the number, the more recent the memory
element.  A memory element's time tag is set when it is first instantiated and
is updated anytime the element is modified.  The bracketed symbolic-atom is the
name of the production which instantiated/modified the element.  In this case,
the elements were instantiated without the use of a production, thus the
predefined symbol NIL is used in place of the normal production name.
<br><br>

<br> 
<b>STRUCTURED DATA</b>

Each class element can have at most one multi-valued attribute called a
vector attribute.  Vector attributes are declared as follows,

    (vector-attribute vectorName {vectorName})
    
for example,

    (vector-attribute airlines-flown)
    
which declares airlines-flown to be a vector when used as an attribute name
in a literalize command.  Note that the order on the vector-attribute and
literalize commands is irrelevant in the language, yet it is recommended that
vector attributes are declared before use in a literalize, to improve
readability.  Several vector attributes can be declared at once, as in,

    (vector-attribute
         airlines-flown              ;  for example, DL US AA BA
         hotels-stayed               ;  for example, HILTON, MARRIOTT, MOTEL6
         rental-car-companies-used   ;  for example, HERTZ, AVIS, BUDGET
    )

    (literalize Employee
           name                        ;  for example, |LEVY I|
           idNumber                    ;  for example, 12345
           total-frequent-flier-miles  ;  for example, 230145
           airlines-flown              ;  the vector attribute
    )
    
etc.  The example above indicates that white space may be used at the
programmer's discretion.  Also, note the use of semicolons to mark comments to
the end of the current line.

<b>PRODUCTIONS</b>

The OPS5 program is a collection of rules known as productions. Productions have the 
form,

     LHS Conditions --&gt; RHS Actions
     
where the condition elements are collectively referred to as the left-hand side
of the production and the actions are referred to as the right-hand side of the
production.

The OPS5 syntax for productions is,

    (p <i>production-name
       LHS</i>
    --&gt;
       <i>RHS</i>
    )

Productions may have any symbolic name except NIL.
<br><br>
<hr>
<br>
<b>LHS CONDITIONS</b>

The condition elements in an OPS5 production are used by the Match-Select-
Execute cycle to chose which actions to perform.  In this way, the
condition elements serve as the only explicit form of control structure
in the language.

Condition elements are parenthesized and always begin with the name of a
working memory element data class.  For example, the condition element,

    (student)
    
would simply be an assertion that one or more student class elements were
currently found in working memory.  Every LHS must have from 1 to 32
condition elements of this form (referred to as positive condition
elements). It is possible to be more specific in the specification of
these elements, though.  For instance,

    (student ^id 99777777)
    
would only be satisfied if there was one (or more) WME with class student
and id attribute equal to 99777777.  Equality is not the only possible
test when matching condition elements to the working memory.  Predicates
supported by OPS5 are,

    Any types of data
    
    =       Same type as and equal to  (default)
    &lt;&gt;      Not same type as or not equal to
    &lt;=&gt;     Same type as

    Integer or Floating-point only
    
    &lt;       Same type as and less than
    &lt;=      Same type as and less than or equal to
    &gt;       Same type as and greater than
    &gt;=      Same type as and greater than or equal to

Thus, we could use the following,

    (student ^gpa &gt; 3.0)
    
to select from among the WME's for student class satisfying the condition
of gpa attribute greater than 3.0.  More complex criteria are possible by
the inclusion of conjunctions (AND conditions) or disjunctions (OR
conditions) whose syntax follows.
    
<i>Conjunctions</i>

Conjunctions are written as a curly-brace delimited set of conditions. 
For instance,

    { &gt; 3.0 &lt; 3.5 }
    
would be a test to ascertain that a value was greater than 3.0 AND less
than 3.5.  The conjunction can be used in a condtion element such as,

    (student ^gpa { &gt; 3.0 &lt; 3.5 })
    
<i>Disjunctions</i>

Disjunctions are wwritten as a double-angle-bracket delimited set of
conditions.  For example,

    &lt;&lt; moe curly larry &gt;&gt;

would be used to test for equality (the default predicate) to the symbol
moe OR curly OR larry.  Recall that case is not significant unless the
symbol is quoted.
   
<i>Negative Condition Elements</i>

A negative condition element is a condition element which is preceded
with a negative sign.  An LHS may have any number of negative condition
elements.  A negative element asserts that a given WME does not exist. 
For example,

    - (student)
    
would assert that no student class WME's are instantiated.  Further,

    - (student ^gpa { &gt; 3.0 &lt; 3.5 })
    
would assert that working memory does not contain any WME's for student
classes with gpa attribute greater than 3.0 and less than 3.5.  Next
consider the following two conditions elements,

    (student ^gpa &lt;&gt; 4.0)

versus,
    
    - (student ^gpa 4.0)
    
At first glance, these seem to have the same meaning, but that is not
correct.  In the first case, the condition element will only be satisfied
if a) there exists at least one student class WME which b) has gpa 
attribute not equal to 4.0.

The second condition means, there is not a student class WME which has a
gpa equal to 4.0.  Note that the subtle difference is that this is true
even if there are NO student class WME's.
    
<i>Variables</i>

Variables in OPS5 are denoted by atoms enclosed in angle brackets such as,

    &lt;gpa&gt;
    
The scope of all variables is the production in which it is used.  There is no 
global communication between variables.  The first use of a variable in a 
production bind a value to the symbolic name.  Each subsequent use of the 
variable references the bound value (there is an exception since OPS5 has
an action which allows a bound value to be changed).

Variables are particularly useful when writing a sequence of condition
elements, such as,

    (student ^id &lt;id-1&gt; ^major &lt;major&gt;)
    (student ^id { &lt;id-2&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;id-1&gt; } ^major &lt;major&gt;)
    
This sequence of conditions can be read as follows,

    a. A student class WME exists with a given is and major attribute value,   
    b. A second student class WME exists with a different id value and the
       same major value, and
    c. &lt;id-1&gt;, &lt;id-2&gt; and &lt;major&gt; are bound to the values
       of the given WME attribute values for the remainder of the production. 

Variables are also useful for communicating a value bound from working memory
to the RHS of a production for a subsequent action.
<br><br>

<br>
<b>RHS ACTIONS</b>

The right hand side of a production contains the actual actions to be
performed by the OPS5 program.  These action include creating, modifying
and deleting WME's, halting the program explciitly, compute arithmetic
values, and performing I/O operations.  Other advanced features are also
available but are outside the scope of this handout.
    
<i>Working memory actions</i>

Three actions are available to modify the working memory.  They are make,
remove and modify.
    
<b>make</b>
To create a WME during runtime, the make action is used.  The syntax for
a make action is,

     (make <i>className</i> {<i>attributeName</i> <i>value</i>})
     
For example,

     (make student)
     (make student ^gpa 4.0)
     (make student ^id &lt;id-2&gt; ^major CS)
     
would create three new WME's of class student.  The first would have no
explicit values bound to its attributes (thus they would all implicitly
be bound to NIL).  The next WME would have all attributes NIL except for
gpa which would be set to 4.0.  The third WME would have the id attribute
set to the value which had previously been bound to &lt;id-2&gt; in the same
production.  Further, the major attribute of this WME would be set to CS.
    
<b>remove</b>
To delete a WME, the remove action is used.  The syntax for a remove is,

    (remove <i>conditionNumber</i>)
    
This form used used to associate a WME with a condition which it matches.
For example, consider the complete production,

    (p example-1
        (student ^gpa &gt; 4.0)   ;  error data
    --&gt;
        (remove 1)
    )
    
 which means, if a WME of class student exists with a gpa attribute
 greater than 4.0, then remove that WME from the working memory.  Note
 that the number 1 in the remove action indicates that the first (and
 only) condition is the one that designates the WME to be removed.  A
 more complex example is,

    (p example-2
        (student ^gpa { &gt; 3.5 &lt;= 4.0 })
        (student ^gpa &gt; 4.0)   ;  error data
    --&gt;
        (remove 2)
    )

Note that the number is remove now indicates that the SECOND condition
element is the element which matches the WME to be deleted.
    
<b>modify</b>
To change the values in a WME without removing the WME and making a new
one, the modify action is used.  The syntax for modify is,

    (modify <i>conditionNumber</i> {<i>attributeName</i> <i>value</i>})
    
For example,

    (p example-3
        (student ^gpa { &gt; 3.5 &lt;= 4.0 })
        (student ^gpa &gt; 4.0)   ;  error data
    --&gt;
        (modify 1)
        (modify 2 ^gpa 4.0)
    )
    
would update the time tag of the WME matching the first condition element
and would both update the time tag and the gpa attibute value of the WME
matching the second condition element.  Values may be literal, computed
or bound to a variable.  For example,

    (p example-4
        (student ^gpa { &lt;gpa&gt; &gt; 3.5 &lt;= 4.0 })
        (student ^gpa &gt; 4.0)   ;  error data
    --&gt;
        (modify 2 ^gpa <gpa>)
    )
    
would update the value of the WME matching the second condition element
by changing its gpa attibute to the value which was bound to &lt;from the
WME matching the first condition.  As always, the time tag of the WME is
updated when the element is modified.  Note that in this case, though,
the WME matching the first condition is not affected at all, thus its
time tag is unchanged.
    
<i>Computational actions</i>
    
<b>compute</b>
Compute is not actually an action, per se, but is a function which returns 
a value.  Usually this (and other) functions are used on the RHS of an
OPS5 production; however, they may also be used on the LHS for some purposes.

Compute allows arithmetic computations using the following operators,

    +      Addition
    -      Subtraction
    *      Multiplication
    //     Division
    \\     Modulus (integer data only)
      
OPS5 uses infix notation and performs all operations at the same level of
precedence, evaluated right to left.  Thus,

      (compute 2 + 3 * 4 + 5)
      
evaluates to 29, not 19.  To override these rules, parenthesized expressions
may be used, for example

      (compute 2 + (3 * 4) + 5)
      
which evaluates to 19.
    
<b>Important notes!</b>
1. As shown above, all values must be separated from operators by whitespace.
2. OPS5 determines the type of an arithmetic expression from the values bound.
For example,

    22 // 5

returns 4 (the integer result of 2 divided by 5.  But consider the following
floating-point expressions and their results:

    2 // .5     returns 4.0
    .2 // 5     returns 0.4000000E-01
    .2 // .5    returns 0.4
   
Mixed-mode expressions evaluate as floating-point, such as,

    22.0 // 5   returns 4.4
    
<i>I/O actions</i>

    <i>File actions</i>
    
        mode ::= IN | OUT | APPEND
        (OPENFILE <i>logical-file VAXfilename mode</i>)    
    
        (CLOSEFILE <i>logical-file</i>) action
        
    <i>Input functions</i>
    
        (ACCEPT [<i>logical-file</i>]) function
                         
        (ACCEPTLINE [<i>logical-file</i>] [<i>default-value</i>]) function
            
    <i>Output actions/functions</i>
    
        (WRITE) action
        
            (CRLF) function 
            (TABTO <i>n</i>) function
            (RJUST <i>n</i>) function
            
        For example,
        
            (WRITE |The value stored is: | <x> (CRLF))
        
<br><br>
<hr>
<br>

<b>PROGRAM FLOW IN OPS5</b>

OPS5 programs are not written like programs in other paradigms.  For example,
there is no traditional control structure in the language.  The notion of
sequential, conditional and repetitive control is replaced by a Match-Select-
Execute algorithm which can be described as,

    repeat
          perform a match between working memory and production memory
          exit if any of the following are true
               the conflict set is empty
               a halt was performed
               the cycle count has been reached
               a breakpoint has been reached
          perform conflict resolution via given strategy
          fire the selected rule
    end

Thus, it is not obvious what order the productions which comprise the
program will be executed without also knowing what data will be provided.  

One cycle of the MSE algorithm can be described in detail by considering an
actual example.  When a rule is satisfied by one or more matches in WM, then
those matches become elements of the <i>conflict set</i>.  When selecting an
element of the conflict set, the following criteria are used to choose among
the elements,

    REFRACTION
    
        This term comes from the neurobiological observation of a <i>refractory
        period</i> for a neuron, which means that the neuron is not able to fire
        immediately without first going through a relaxation process.  In a 
        similar way, OPS5 will not allow the same instantiation in the conflict 
        set from firing twice in a row.  This prevents the inference engine from
        entering into an infinite loop.
        
    RECENCY
    
        When selecting between two instantiations, select the one whose time
        tag is most recent, at the first point of difference.
        
    SPECIFICITY
    
        If the recency of two or more instantiations is equal, select the most
        specific instantiation.  Specificity is determined by the number of 
        conditions which must be met by the LHS of the production.  Each of the 
        following is considered to be a test by the LHS:
        
            Class name
            Disjunction
            Value preceeded by a predicate (except in a disjunction)
            All occurrences of a variable, except the first

To understand this conflict resolution strategy, consider the following state of
working memory,

    #1 1 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 1)
    #2 2 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 42)
    #3 3 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA -4)
    #4 4 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 1 ^TYPE NUMBER ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #5 5 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 77 ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #6 6 [NIL] (BEGIN)

and the following productions,


    (p rule-1
       (begin)
       (value ^data &lt; 0 ^positive NIL)         
    --&gt;
       (modify 2 ^positive FALSE)
    )

    (p rule-2
       (begin)
       (value ^data &gt; 0 ^positive NIL)           
    --&gt;
       (modify 2 ^positive TRUE)
    )

    (p rule-3
       (begin)
       (value ^data { <x> &gt; 0 })                
     - (value ^data &gt; <x>)                      
     - (value ^positive NIL)                    
    --&gt;
       (write |Largest value: | (tabto 20) <x> (crlf))
       (remove 1)
       (remove 2)
       (make normal-values)
    )

    (p rule-4

    (p rule-4-specific
       (normal-values)

     - (value ^data &gt; <x>)

The program, a file with extention .OPS, is entered via the VAX text editor.
To compile the source code give the VAX command,

    $ OPS/EXE filename
    
then,

    $ RUN filename
    
to enter the OPS environment.  Note: If the startup statement in the OPS5
program contains a (RUN) command, then the OPS5 environment will not be 
visible during runtime.

We can examine the intial conflict set by using the OPS5 command,

    OPS5&gt;cs
    
    RULE-1 #6 6  #3 3
    RULE-2 #6 6  #2 2
    RULE-2 #6 6  #1 1

Note that this means that three instantiations are vying for selection at
this time.  RULE-1 matches its first condition to WME #6 (time tag 6) and
WME #3 (time tag 3).  RULE-1 also matches WME #6 and WME #2 (time tag 2).
The conflict resolution strategy says that Recency is the first consideration.
Hence, 6|3 is more recent than 6|2 or 6|1.  Thus, RULE-1 fires using the data
from WME's with time tags 6 and 3, leaving WM:

    OPS5&gt;run 1
    OPS5&gt;wm

    #1 1 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 1)
    #2 2 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 42)
    #4 4 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 1 ^TYPE NUMBER ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #5 5 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 77 ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #6 6 [NIL] (BEGIN)
    #3 7 [RULE-1] (VALUE ^DATA -4 ^POSITIVE FALSE)

and the second conflict set is,

    OPS5&gt;cs
    
    RULE-2 #6 6  #2 2
    RULE-2 #6 6  #1 1

again, Recency is the deciding factor.  RULE-2 will fire with time tags 6 and 2
as the WME's.  On the third cycle, RULE-2 will fire with time tags 6 and 1, leaving,

    OPS5&gt;run 2
    OPS5&gt;wm
    #4 4 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 1 ^TYPE NUMBER ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #5 5 [NIL] (VALUE ^DATA 77 ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #6 6 [NIL] (BEGIN)
    #3 7 [RULE-1] (VALUE ^DATA -4 ^POSITIVE FALSE)
    #2 8 [RULE-2] (VALUE ^DATA 42 ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    #1 9 [RULE-2] (VALUE ^DATA 1 ^POSITIVE TRUE)
    
    OPS5&gt;cs
    RULE-3 #6 6  #5 5

RULE-3 contains the write action, so output is generated in this cycle and the 
conflict set becomes,

    RULE-4 #7 10  #2 8
    RULE-4-SPECIFIC #7 10  #2 8

Note that in this case, Recency is not useful since both rules refer to the same
time tags.  In that case, we next look to Specificity as the dominant ruler.  In
RULE-4 the LHS contains 4 tests, while RULE-4-SPECIFIC contains 5 tests, thus the
more specific rule fires.

   (p rule-4
       (normal-values)                    ; 1 test                     
       (value ^data &lt;x&gt;)                  ; 1 test
     - (value ^data &gt; &lt;x&gt;)                ; 2 tests
    --&gt;
       (write (tabto 20) &lt;x&gt; (crlf))
       (remove 2)
    )

    (p rule-4-specific  
       (normal-values)                    ; 1 test
       (value ^data &lt;x&gt; ^positive TRUE)   ; 2 tests
     - (value ^data &gt; &lt;x&gt;)                ; 2 tests
    --&gt;
       (write (tabto 20) &lt;x&gt; (crlf))
       (remove 2)
    )

OPS5 Environment Commands

Note:  All of the following commands can be issued at the OPS5&gt; prompt or within
the STARTUP statement of the program.  Other commands are also available;
consult the OPS5 Reference Manual for further details.
