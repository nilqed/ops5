#### Forked from [github.com/sharplispers/ops5](https://github.com/sharplispers/ops5)
This repository contains a Common Lisp implementation of
[OPS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPS5). It was obtained from the
[CMU AI
Archive](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/expert/systems/ops5/0.html)
on January 16, 2020, and modified by Zachary Beane to build and run on
modern (as of 2020) Common Lisp implementations.

The original software and all updates by Zachary Beane are in the
public domain.

The original, unchanged README file is available unchanged as
[README.orig](README.orig).
